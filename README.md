# 🏠 dasmlab_home

**`dasmlab_home`** is the main landing page and interactive dashboard for the DASMLAB ecosystem — a living lab environment showcasing projects, infrastructure, and integrations. This project is designed as a modern, performant Vue.js-based SPA (Single Page Application) built with the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev), and fully containerized for scalable deployment across Kubernetes environments.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Vue.js 3 + Quasar-based SPA**  
  Built with Vue Router navigation, composable-driven state patterns, and Quasar components for fast UI scaffolding.

- 🔌 **Live Data via SSE (Server-Sent Events)**  
  Real-time updates from backend agents and controllers streamed directly into the interface.

- 🧩 **Modular Component Design**  
  Includes reusable `ProjectCard`, `DesignCarousel`, and `VisitCounter` components with evolving design-system styling. (WhatsNew deprecated in 0.7.0 — see `docs/TARGET-0.7.0.md`.)

- 📦 **Containerized Deployment**  
  Packaged via `nginx` as a static web asset container. Wrapped using `buildme.sh` and `runme.sh` for local or CI builds.

- 🚀 **CI/CD Ready with GitHub Actions & K8s Envelope**  
  Integrated into a 5-phase pipeline (Build, Run, Secure, Validate, Publish) that publishes to a GitOps target repository for live deployment via Flux or ArgoCD.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

To build and run this project locally or in CI, ensure the following are installed:

| Tool        | Version      | Link                                |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu      | 22.04+       | https://ubuntu.com/download         |
| Node.js     | ≥ 18.x       | https://nodejs.org/en/download      |
| npm         | ≥ 9.x        | https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading |
| Docker      | ≥ 24.x       | https://docs.docker.com/get-docker |
| Quasar CLI  | ≥ 2.x        | https://quasar.dev/start/installation |

Install Quasar globally:

```bash
npm install -g @quasar/cli
```

---

## 🧪 Development Setup

To run in local dev mode (hot reload, dev server):

```bash
quasar dev
```

To build the production container and run it locally:

```bash
./buildme.sh
./runme.sh
```

This will expose the containerized app at:  
👉 http://localhost:8080

## 🔄 CI/CD + Deployment Pipeline

This project is fully wired into a GitHub Actions pipeline that follows a **5-phase structure**:

1. **Build** – Quasar app is built into static assets  
2. **Run** – Container image is assembled using `nginx`  
3. **Secure** – Security scans (Trivy, custom DAST/SAST hooks)  
4. **Validate** – Runtime container tests & image inspection  
5. **Publish** – Final image is pushed to registry and K8s manifest is templated and sent to:

```
lmcdasm/dasmlab_live_cicd/
└── clusters/
    └── dasmlab-prod-1/
        └── dasmlab_home/<tagged_manifest>.yaml
```

 See: [DASMLAB LIVE CICD REPO](https://github.com/lmcdasm/dasmlab_live_cicd)

This GitOps target repo is picked up by **FluxCD** or **ArgoCD**, which applies the deployment to the live cluster.
